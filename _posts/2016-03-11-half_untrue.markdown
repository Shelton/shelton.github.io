## The lie
Well, I got my Ancestry DNA report back and by its estimate, I've been lying to people my entire life. I am not sure if it is a lie since I never knew the actual truth. Friends, family, and people that care, I am not simply half white half black. It is more like 40% African and 57% European. Wow, that is going to be a mouthful when people ask. I am not sure what this means. I think I am just going to start telling people I am Western European and just shut up to see how long they can last without asking, "Yes, and what else?" My excited response, "Less than 1% Western Asian!"

## The breakdown
Here is what I do know, the African majority of my genetic makeup comes from the Ivory Coast and Ghana. From my high school knowledge of the slave trade, it makes me wonder if this is what brought my DNA line over to the United States and at what time. More thoughts and research to come...
